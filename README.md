# Dynamic Form using ReactJs

Website Link: https://dynamic-form-antstack.herokuapp.com/

This project was developed for an assignment provided by Antstack company. The website is built using ReactJS. I used my previous work of ReactJs [contact form - check my repo] as the base for this assignment. 

I am passionate about creating websites and mobile applications. Since I had two assignments from other companies, I couldn't give my 100% to this assignment. Hope you guys liked my work done within a day. Any suggestions would be appreciated, please guide on the next process.

## To run this project in your IDE:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install bootstrap using - npm install bootstrap
